# Payment Method Reuse Implementation

This implementation allows users to reuse their previously saved payment methods (cards) and automatically fill out the payment form based on data saved in Stripe.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Payment Methods API
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/payment-methods/[customerId]`
- Retrieves all saved payment methods for a customer
- Returns formatted payment method data including card details

### 2. Payment Method Selector Component
- **Component**: `app/components/PaymentMethodSelector.tsx`
- Displays saved payment methods in a user-friendly interface
- Allows users to select from their saved cards
- Auto-selects the first available payment method

### 3. Direct Subscription Creation
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/create-subscription-direct`
- Creates subscriptions using saved payment methods without Stripe Checkout
- Bypasses the need for additional payment collection

### 4. Enhanced Checkout Flow
- **Updated**: `app/signature-status/page.tsx`
- Integrates payment method selection into the signature completion flow
- Provides seamless transition from document signing to subscription creation

## How It Works

### Flow Overview
1. User completes document signing
2. System checks for saved payment methods
3. If payment methods exist:
   - Displays them in a selection interface
   - Allows user to choose a saved card
   - Creates subscription directly using selected payment method
4. If no payment methods exist:
   - Falls back to standard Stripe Checkout flow

### API Endpoints

#### Get Payment Methods
```http
GET /api/payment-methods/:customerId
```
Response:
```json
{
  "paymentMethods": [
    {
      "id": "pm_1234567890",
      "type": "card",
      "card": {
        "brand": "visa",
        "last4": "4242",
        "expMonth": 12,
        "expYear": 2025,
        "funding": "credit"
      },
      "billingDetails": {
        "email": "user@example.com",
        "name": "John Doe"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Create Subscription Directly
```http
POST /api/create-subscription-direct
```
Body:
```json
{
  "customerId": "cus_1234567890",
  "paymentMethodId": "pm_1234567890",
  "location": "EU",
  "productType": "SLA",
  "slaTier": "Gold",
  "includeSubscription": true,
  "ref": "referral-code"
}
```

## Usage

### Frontend Integration
The PaymentMethodSelector component can be used anywhere you need to display saved payment methods:

```tsx
import PaymentMethodSelector from '@/app/components/PaymentMethodSelector';

<PaymentMethodSelector 
  customerId="cus_1234567890" 
  onPaymentMethodSelect={(paymentMethodId) => {
    // Handle payment method selection
  }} 
/>
```

### Backend Integration
When creating subscriptions, the system now supports two flows:

1. **Standard Checkout Flow**: Uses Stripe Checkout for new payment methods
2. **Direct Subscription Flow**: Uses saved payment methods without additional user interaction

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Create a customer with saved payment methods in Stripe
2. Navigate to the signature-status page with customerId parameter
3. Complete document signing
4. Verify payment methods are displayed correctly
5. Select a payment method and complete subscription
6. Verify subscription is created successfully

### Test Scenarios
- Customer with multiple saved payment methods
- Customer with no saved payment methods (fallback to checkout)
- Invalid payment method selection
- Network error handling

## Security Considerations
- All API endpoints validate customer ownership
- Payment method IDs are validated against the customer
- No sensitive card data is exposed to the frontend
- All operations use Stripe's secure infrastructure

## Future Enhancements
- Add ability to add new payment methods inline
- Support for multiple payment method types (bank accounts, etc.)
- Payment method management interface
- Subscription upgrade/downgrade flows
